 In the busy hotels of our place, sometimes we feel frustrated after reserving food and waiting for the delivery.It is often hard to find the price and availability of the food items. Inorder to overcome these difficulties, it would be better if the system is automated.As far as this issue is concerned, the paper menu can be replaced by digital menu and the service can be automated. The price,availability and delivery time of the food items can be viewed from the digital menu which will be connected via our smart phones.The customers can book their needs by mentioning the table number which they have been seated. The hotel kitchen managers can update the availability of the items and also view the booking by the customers. The service can be automated by viewing the booking of customers and thereby waiters could easily deliver it to the corresponding tables.
        This idea would be beneficial to customers as well as hotel owners since wastage of time by waiting for the delivery of food has been reduced here. In business view, this could mark a considerable profit for hotels and hence this idea can be initiated with no doubt.
