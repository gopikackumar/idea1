 In the busy hotels of our place, sometimes we feel frustrated after reserving food and waiting for the delivery.It is often hard to find the price and availability of the food items. Inorder to overcome these difficulties, it would be better if the system is automated.As far as this issue is concerned, the paper menu can be replaced by digital menu and the service can be automated. The price,availability and delivery time of the food items can be viewed from the digital menu which will be connected via our smart phones.The customer can book their needs by mentioning the table number which they have been seated. The hotel kitchen managers can update the availability of the items and also view the booking by the customers.
